## Project Goals

TODO: **A clear description of the goals of your project.** Describe the question that you are enabling a user to answer. The question should be compelling and the solution should be focused on helping users achieve their goals.

Covid-19 has impacted the hospitality industry significantly. Airbnb is one of the most affected businesses with the travel restrictions across countries and regions. With this project, we aimed to illustrate the impact of Covid-19 on the Airbnb listings. Using this interactive tool, users can inspect the Airbnb listings in major US cities to see whether the number of listings, prices, or demand has changed over time, especially after Covid-19. In addition to the monthly updated listings per neighborhood, our tool displays the number of Covid-19 cases from using the current data from the CovidCast tool.

Our tool benefits two user groups. First, it enables hosts to monitor the changes in their listingâ€™s neighborhood with regard to Covid-19 to make informed decisions on whether to list or not. Second, it allows users to make better judgments on assessing the risks of staying at an Airbnb listing in particular cities and neighborhoods.

## Detailed Interaction Scenario

The users select a US city using the sidebar to view the Airbnb listings on a map view. In addition to this main map view, there are three charts showing the trends in the number of listings, median price, and occupancy/demand. Using the map view or the sidebar, the users can filter their selection based on the room type, rental size, and property price. For example, a host might filter all the studio listings in his neighborhood to monitor trends in price and demand in light of Covid-19.
